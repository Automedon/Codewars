/*
Description:
Welcome to yet another kata on palindromes!

Your job is to return a string with 2 requirements:

1 . The first half of the string should represent a proper function expression in your chosen language.

2 . The string should be a palindrome.

Wait... that's too easy -- let's add one more requirement:

Call x the sum of the character codes of the full string we want to return.

To pass the kata, make sure the function represented in your string will return x when it is given as an input.

  return "n=>nn>=n"
}
