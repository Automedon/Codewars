Description:
In genetic algorithms, crossover is a genetic operator used to vary the programming of chromosomes from one generation to the next.

The one-point crossover consists in swapping one's cromosome part with another in a specific given point. The image bellow shows the crossover being applied on chromosomes 1011011001111 and 1011100100110 with the cut point (index) 4:



In this kata you have to implement a function crossover that receives two chromosomes chromosome1, chromosome2 and a zero-based index and it has to return an array with the crossover result on both chromosomes [chromosome1, chromosome2].

Example:
crossover('111000', '000110', 3) should return ['111110', 000000']
*/

const crossover = (chromosome1, chromosome2, index) => {
return [
    chromosome1.slice(0, index) + chromosome2.slice(index),
    chromosome2.slice(0, index) + chromosome1.slice(index)
  ]
};
