/*
Description:
You're familiar with list slicing in Python and know, for example, that:

>>> ages = [12, 14, 63, 72, 55, 24]
>>> ages[2:4]
[63, 72]
>>> ages[2:]
[63, 72, 55, 24]
>>> ages[:3]
[12, 14, 63]
write a function inverse_slice() that takes three arguments: a list items, an integer a and an integer b. The function should return a new list with the slice specified by items[a:b] excluded. For example:

>>>inverse_slice([12, 14, 63, 72, 55, 24], 2, 4)
[12, 14, 55, 24]
The input will always be a valid list, a and b will always be different integers equal to or greater than zero, but they may be zero or be larger than the length of the list.
*/

function inverseSlice(items, a, b) {
  return items.slice(0, a).concat(items.slice(b));
}
