/*
Description:
Write a function filterLucky/filter_lucky() that accepts a list of integers and filters the list to only include the elements that contain the digit 7.

For example,

ghci> filterLucky [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,68,69,70,15,17]
[7,70,17]
Don't worry about bad input, you will always receive a finite list of integers.
*/

var filterLucky = x => {
  return x.filter(v => v.toString().includes(7));
};
