/*
Description:
In this Kata, you will learn how to remove all empty items in an Array.

In JavaScript, empty items in arrays can be declared by [1, 2,,,3, 4] (Multiple commas without a value in that index)

The values that are not given a value are empty items, and usually add up with others to form <# empty items>; In the example, <2 empty items>

[1, 2, <2 empty items>, 3, 4] should be cleared such that it should be [1, 2, 3, 4]

Example:

Before: [1, 2, 3, <5 empty items>, 4, <1 empty item>, null, undefined];

After: [1, 2, 3, 4, null, undefined];
*/
function clean(arr) {
  return arr.filter(v=>v!==true)
  }
