/*
Description:
We have to create a function that receives a connection string with password included and you have to mask the password i.e. change password by asterisks.

Preconditions:

non empty valid url
password always next to string section password=
assume password will not contain ampersand sign for sake of simplicity
to make it more real it has non ASCII characters
"password=" and "user" will occur only once
empty passwords are not validated but best solutions take empty passwords into account

Example:

input
jdbc:mysql://sdasdasdasd:szdasdasd:dfsdfsdfsdf/sdfsdfsdf?user=root&password=12345

output
jdbc:mysql://sdasdasdasd:szdasdasd:dfsdfsdfsdf/sdfsdfsdf?user=root&password=*****

function hidePasswordFromConnection(urlString) {
  return urlString.replace(/password=([^&]*)/, ($1, $2) => `password=${'*'.repeat($2.length)}`);
}
