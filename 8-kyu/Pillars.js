distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

function pillars(num_pill, dist, width) {
  // your code here
  return num_pill>1?(num_pill-1)*dist*100+(num_pill-2)*width:0;
}
