This kata is from check py.checkio.org

You are given an array with positive numbers and a number N. You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.

Let's look at a few examples:

array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3^2 == 9;
array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.
*/
function index(array, n){
  if (array.length-1-n<0) return -1
  return Math.pow(array[n],n)
}
