/*
Description:
Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the array.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Write a function that takes such list and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match:

if x>y - 3 points
if x<y - 0 point
if x=y - 1 point
Notes:

there are 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4
*/

const points=games=>games.reduce((output,current)=>{
    return output += current[0]>current[2] ? 3 : current[0]===current[2] ? 1 : 0;
  },0)
