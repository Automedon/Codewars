Description:
Terminal game turn function
You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.

You are using a library (Game.Logic in C#) that already has the functions below. Create a function named doTurn/DoTurn/do_turn that calls the functions in the proper order as described in the paragraph above.

- combat
- buyHealth
- getCoins
- printStatus
- rollDice
- move
*/

function doTurn () {
 rollDice(),
  move(),
  combat(),
  getCoins(),
  buyHealth(),
  printStatus()
}
