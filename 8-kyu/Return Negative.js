/*
Description:
In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:

makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
Notes:

The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

function makeNegative(num) {
  return -Math.abs(num);
}
