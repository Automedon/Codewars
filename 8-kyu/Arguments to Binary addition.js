/*
Description:
Given an array add all the number elements and return the binary equivalent of that sum; to make the code bullet proof anything else than a number should be addeded as 0 since it can't be addeded.

If your language can handle float binaries assume the array won't contain float or doubles.

arr2bin([1,2]) == '11'
arr2bin([1,2,'a']) == '11'
arr2bin([]) == '0'

NOTE: NaN is a number too in javascript for decimal, binary and n-ary base
This is a modification on the Kata: Array2Binary addition hope you like it

function arr2bin(arr){
  return arr
    .reduce(
      (total, value) => (typeof value === 'number' ? total + value : total),
      0
    )
    .toString(2)
}
