Description:
Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

-If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".

-If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

function hoopCount (n) {
   return n>=10? "Great, now move on to tricks":"Keep at it until you get it" 
}
