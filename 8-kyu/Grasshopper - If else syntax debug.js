Description:
If/else syntax debug
While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to create a function to check if the user is still alive called checkAlive/CheckAlive. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.

checkAlive/CheckAlive should return true if the player's health is greater than 0 or false if it is 0 or below.

checkAlive receives one parameter health which will always be a whole number between -10 and 10.
*/

function checkAlive(health) {
  return health > 0;
}
