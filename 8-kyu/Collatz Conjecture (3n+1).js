/*
Description:
The Collatz conjecture (also known as 3n+1 conjecture) is a conjecture that applying the following algorithm to any number we will always eventually reach one:

[This is writen in pseudocode]
if(number is even) number = number / 2
if(number is odd) number = 3*number + 1
#Task

Your task is to make a function hotpo that takes a positive n as input and returns the number of times you need to perform this algorithm to get n = 1.

#Examples

hotpo(1) returns 0
(1 is already 1)

hotpo(5) returns 5
5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

hotpo(6) returns 8
6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

hotpo(23) returns 15
23 -> 70 -> 35 -> 106 -> 53 -> 160 -> 80 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

const hotpo = (n, acc = 0) =>
  n <= 1 ? acc : hotpo(n % 2 === 0 ? n / 2 : 3 * n + 1, acc + 1)
