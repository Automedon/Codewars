Description:
The test fixture I use for this kata is pre-populated.

It will compare your guess to a random number generated using:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1)
You can pass by relying on luck or skill but try not to rely on luck.

"The power to define the situation is the ultimate power." - Jerry Rubin

Good luck!
