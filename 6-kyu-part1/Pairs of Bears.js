/*
Description:
In order to prove it's success and gain funding, the wilderness zoo needs to prove to environmentalists that it has x number of mating pairs of bears.

You must check within string (s) to fid all of the mating pairs, and return a string containing only them. Line them up for inspection.

Rules: Bears are either 'B' (male) or '8' (female), Bears must be together in male/female pairs 'B8' or '8B', Mating pairs must involve two distinct bears each ('B8B' may look fun, but does not count as two pairs).

Return an array containing a string of only the mating pairs available. e.g:

'EvHB8KN8ik8BiyxfeyKBmiCMj' ---> 'B88B' (empty string if there are no pairs)

and true if the number is more than or equal to x, false if not:

(6, 'EvHB8KN8ik8BiyxfeyKBmiCMj') ---> ['B88B', false];

x will always be a positive integer, and s will never be empty
*/
function bears(x, s){
  let match = s.match(/8B|B8/g)||['']
  return [match.join``,match.length>=x]
}
