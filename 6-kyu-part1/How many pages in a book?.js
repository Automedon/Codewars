/*
Every book has n pages with page numbers 1 to n. The summary is made by adding up the number of digits of all page numbers.

Task: Given the summary, find the number of pages n the book has.

Example
If the input is summary=25, then the output must be n=17: The numbers 1 to 17 have 25 digits in total: 1234567891011121314151617.

Be aware that you'll get enormous books having up to 100.000 pages.

All inputs will be valid.

Here's the opposite kata, which is more complex (Paginating a huge book)

function amountOfPages(summary){
  let counter = 1;
  let string = '';

  while(string.length < summary) {
    string += counter
    counter++
  }
  return counter - 1
}
