/*
You have a two-dimensional list in the following format:

data = [[2, 5], [3, 4], [8, 7]]
Each sub-list contains two items, and each item in the sub-lists is an integer.

Write a function process_data()/processData() that processes each sub-list like so:

[2, 5] --> 2 - 5 --> -3
[3, 4] --> 3 - 4 --> -1
[8, 7] --> 8 - 7 --> 1
and then returns the product of all the processed sub-lists: -3 * -1 * 1 --> 3.

For input, you can trust that neither the main list nor the sublists will be empty.

function processData(data){
  return data.reduce((a,[b,c])=>a*(b-c),1)
}
