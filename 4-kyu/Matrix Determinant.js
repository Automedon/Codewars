Description:
Write a function that accepts a square matrix (N x N 2D array) and returns the determinant of the matrix.

How to take the determinant of a matrix -- it is simplest to start with the smallest cases:

A 1x1 matrix |a| has determinant a.

A 2x2 matrix [ [a, b], [c, d] ] or

|a  b|
|c  d|
has determinant: a*d - b*c.

The determinant of an n x n sized matrix is calculated by reducing the problem to the calculation of the determinants of n matrices ofn-1 x n-1 size.

For the 3x3 case, [ [a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i] ] or

|a b c|  
|d e f|  
|g h i|  
the determinant is: a * det(a_minor) - b * det(b_minor) + c * det(c_minor) where det(a_minor) refers to taking the determinant of the 2x2 matrix created by crossing out the row and column in which the element a occurs:

|- - -|
|- e f|
|- h i|  
Note the alternation of signs.

The determinant of larger matrices are calculated analogously, e.g. if M is a 4x4 matrix with first row [a, b, c, d], then:

det(M) = a * det(a_minor) - b * det(b_minor) + c * det(c_minor) - d * det(d_minor)
*/
const determinant = m => m.length === 1 ? m[0][0] : m[0].reduce((s, n, i) => s + (i % 2 === 0 ? 1 : -1) * n * determinant(m.slice(1).map(r => r.filter((_, j) => j !== i))), 0);
